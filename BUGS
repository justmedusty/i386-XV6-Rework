formatting:
	need to fix PAGEBREAK mechanism

sh:
	can't always runcmd in child -- breaks cd.
	maybe should hard-code PATH=/ ?


mountfs : WIP does not yet work


sighandler : Sig handling doesn't work yet, I need to use copyin/copyout or something similar to get this working


secondary ide disk : Still broken figuring out how to get the ATA 2 master accessible via its ports in idewait()
